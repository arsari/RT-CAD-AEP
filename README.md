# Customer Segmentation and Real-time Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

I look to develop a real-time customer analytics dashboard that pulls data from Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and visualizes it with Python. This dashboard will allow users to explore customer journeys, segmentation, and key metrics intuitively and interactively. The back end will use Python to query data from AEP and possibly Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) via API, and the front end will display this information dynamically.

Building a project that integrates Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) with Python and showcases my skills in both Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) and data visualization would be a great way to highlight my abilities. This project showcases my technical skills with Adobe’s platforms, my ability to work with APIs and data processing in Python, and my understanding of front-end development. It’s a versatile, real-world project that could be highly valuable to potential employers or clients!

## Technologies Involved

- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP): Data ingestion, segmentation, and API interactions.
- Python: For back-end data processing and logic (Flask).
- JavaScript: For front-end development.
- Free Hosting Platforms: Render.com for hosting.
- APIs: Adobe AEP API, Customer Journey Analytics API.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Adobe Experience Platform Integration: Understanding and working with Adobe’s APIs, schema creation, and data flow.
- Data Science & Python: Data manipulation, customer segmentation, and visualization.
- Front-end Development: Dynamic, real-time dashboards using modern JavaScript frameworks.
- Back-end Engineering: API integration, server-side data processing, and deployment on cloud hosting services.
