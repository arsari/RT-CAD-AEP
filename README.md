# Project: Customer Segmentation and Real-time Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview:

I look to develop a real-time customer analytics dashboard that pulls data from Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and visualizes it with Python. This dashboard will allow users to explore customer journeys, segmentation, and key metrics intuitively and interactively. The back end will use Python to query data from AEP and possibly Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) via API, and the front end will display this information dynamically.

Building a project that integrates Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) with Python and showcases my skills in both Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) and data visualization would be a great way to highlight my abilities. The project is hosted on Render.com.
